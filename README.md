# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Description:
This project revolves around analyzing a pizza sales dataset consisting of four main files: order_details, orders, pizza_types, and pizzas. Utilizing SQL, we have addressed 13 key questions to extract insights and enhance understanding of the data. Our analysis focuses on identifying top-selling pizzas and deriving actionable insights aimed at increasing overall revenue.

**Through this project, we aimed to:**

* Utilize SQL queries to explore and manipulate data from the four datasets.
* Identify the best-selling pizzas based on quantity and revenue.
* Generate insights that can inform strategic decisions to boost total revenue.

## Analysis Approach:

**Data Exploration:** In this phase, I gained insights into the structure and content of each dataset. 

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The pizza sales data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Power BI.

**SQL Queries:** Executed SQL queries to answer specific questions and extract insights. 

## Sample Insights:
* The top three most ordered pizzas based on sales are The Classic Deluxe Pizza, The Barbecue Chicken Pizza and The Hawaiian Pizza.
* Suggesting pricing adjustments based on profitability analysis.
* Proposing promotional offers or bundles to increase average order value.
* Identifying potential new pizza offerings based on customer preferences.
