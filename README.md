# Pizza Sales Project Using SQL
## Project Description:

This project revolves around analyzing a pizza sales dataset consisting of four main files: order_details, orders, pizza_types, and pizzas. Utilizing SQL, we have addressed 13 key questions to extract insights and enhance understanding of the data. Our analysis focuses on identifying top-selling pizzas and deriving actionable insights aimed at increasing overall revenue.

** Through this project, we aimed to:

* Utilize SQL queries to explore and manipulate data from the four datasets.
* Identify the best-selling pizzas based on quantity and revenue.
* Generate insights that can inform strategic decisions to boost total revenue.
